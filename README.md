#Dynanimator
An animation package for the Dynamo visual programming environment, developed as part of the [Dynamo Hackathon](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/autodesk-university-2014-dynamo-hackathon) at [Autodesk University 2014](http://au.autodesk.com). Find more information and some nice animations in [this blog post](http://vasshaug.net/2014/12/18/animate-design-iterations-in-revit-with-dynamo/) by [Håvard Vasshaug](https://github.com/vasshaug).


##Project Goals
This package was developed for animating several aspects of a Revit model:
- Element parameters [done]
- Element transparency [done]
- Element surface color [done]
- Camera (and target) position of perspective views [partially done]
- Sun position
- Displacement sets [under review]
- Phases
- ...
 
##Installation
Installation is simple - just use Dynamo's built-in package manager and search for ```Dynanimator```.
Please note that this package has dependencies - during installation it will also install the package ```Clockwork```.

##Collaborate
If you have an idea about animating other parts of a Revit model using Dynamo, please contact us - either by [creating a feature request](https://github.com/andydandy74/Dynanimator/issues) or (better yet) by [forking this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and adding your code via [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
